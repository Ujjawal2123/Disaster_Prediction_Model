# Disaster_Prediction_Model
This project is a machine learning-based image classification system that identifies the type of disaster depicted in a photo. The model is trained to recognize various disaster types such as earthquakes, wildfires, floods, hurricanes, and more. This solution can be used in disaster management systems to quickly identify the type of catastrophe.
